# Welcome to my website!
This is simply a revised version of one of my outputs, just with a changed color theme and topic. I also included JavaScript functions as well as Animate on Scroll (AOS), to add some flair to it. This is my final project for Introduction to Computing (ITC).

Also, you may notice that the first commits were under a different name, which doesn't mean that I did not make this entire project. It just so happens that this PC was previously used by my father, who happens to also be a programmer that regularly uses GitHub.
