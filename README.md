# Welcome to my website!
This is simply a revised version of one of my outputs, just with a changed color theme and topic. I also included JavaScript functions as well as Animate on Scroll (AOS), to add some flair to it. 
## How to download: 
In the top bar just below the repository title, click "Code", and then click "Download ZIP" to download the entire file. Do not forget to unzip the file before using.
### When using:
The main file is located at "index. html". Please click that to access the home page of the website.
# Sources
A lot of images, descriptions, animations and JavaScript portions are sourced online.
