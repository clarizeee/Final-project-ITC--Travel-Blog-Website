                    <p>Located at Hitachi Seaside Park, it is a wide public park in Ibaraki, famous country wide for its various seasonal flowers blooming throughout the year, notably nemophilia flowers in early summer! </p>
                    <p class="mcontent hidden">Nemophila is commonly known as Baby Blue Eyes. It is said that newborn babies of European heritage usually have blue eyes, no matter what color they will later become.
    
                        As the name suggests, Nemophila is a transparent round-shaped flower with a sky-blue color, just as bright and pure like the color of a babyâ€™s eyes. This color is found comparatively rare in the vegetal world, and this may be the reason why it receives so much attention.
